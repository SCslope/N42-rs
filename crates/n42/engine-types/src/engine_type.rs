//! This example shows how to implement a custom [EngineTypes].
//!
//! The [EngineTypes] trait can be implemented to configure the engine to work with custom types,
//! as long as those types implement certain traits.
//!
//! Custom payload attributes can be supported by implementing two main traits:
//!
//! [PayloadAttributes] can be implemented for payload attributes types that are used as
//! arguments to the `engine_forkchoiceUpdated` method. This type should be used to define and
//! _spawn_ payload jobs.
//!
//! [PayloadBuilderAttributes] can be implemented for payload attributes types that _describe_
//! running payload jobs.
//!
//! Once traits are implemented and custom types are defined, the [EngineTypes] trait can be
//! implemented:

#![cfg_attr(not(test), warn(unused_crate_dependencies))]
